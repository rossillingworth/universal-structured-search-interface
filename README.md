universal-structured-search-interface
=====================================

a way of identifying structured search co-ordinates: where you are looking for data, what you are looking for, how you want to search for it

FYI: this is MPL licensed - so all modifications will inherit an OSS license.
ie: they can be copied by anyone.

This is to stop companies extending this and claiming it belongs to them.
Especially as javascript is all publicly available anyway.
