universal-structured-search-interface
=====================================

a way of identifying structured search co-ordinates: 
where you are looking for data
what you are looking for
how you want to search for it

Introducing Maverick (MVC)
==============
In creating this, I have refactored it into a new Web-ELements type API.
- Construct classes with inheritance
- XML data elements in the page
- Template replacement
- Could be client or server side


License
============

This is MPL licensed - and all modifications will inherit an MPL license.
ie: they can be copied by anyone.
