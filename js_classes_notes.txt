JS classes
================

Contract Vs convention


If a JS class is built with: new function ClassName(){}...
then it will be properly autocompleted in IDEs

If it is built using:
John Resigs Class.extend({})
My CLASS.register({})
My Object.Factory({})
... then it will NOT autocomplete properly.
