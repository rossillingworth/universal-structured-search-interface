? templates for every XML tag -> completely custom HTML

? children tag in each template, used to contain child tags
ie: when parent is removed, removes all children
- if container is span, should wrap around well

? + SVG in templates, with HTML inside?
- allows totally custom components - but configurable

? + CANVAS in templates?
- same features as SVG?
- can I embed HTML inside Canvas ?

Canvas
=========
Resolution dependent
No support for event handlers
Poor text rendering capabilities
You can save the resulting image as .png or .jpg
Well suited for graphic-intensive games
? what browsers support this?

SVG
====
Resolution independent
Support for event handlers
Best suited for applications with large rendering areas (Google Maps)
Slow rendering if complex (anything that uses the DOM a lot will be slow)
Not suited for game applications
? what browsers support this?
- allowed - SVG in: img, CSS background,

NB:
-----
YOU CAN SAVE CANVAS AS PNG!!!
